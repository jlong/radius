== 0.6.1
* Fixed a problem with non-tags that have no prefix or tag name (see test_parse_chirpy_bird)

== 0.6.0 (private release)
* Split radius.rb into multiple files.
* Ported the really hairy regexes from Radius::Parser to a single Ragel machine.
* Added and refactored tests.
* Refactored Rakefile and other administrativia.

== 0.5.1
* Fixed a problem with parsing quotes where a single tag preceding a double tag would consume the start tag of the double tag if both contained attributes.

== 0.5.0
* Created a DSL for tag definitions (introducing a DSL makes this version of Radiant incompatible with the last). The DSL has the following features:
  - full support for nested tags
  - global and local tag variables
  - Contexts can now be defined dynamically (instead of being subclassed)
  - see the QUICKSTART for more info
* Many refactorings of the library and unit tests.
* Changed the license to the MIT-LICENSE.
* Updated documentation to reflect the changes.
* Updated the version number to reflect the maturity of the code base.

== 0.0.2
* Refactored Parser to use Context#render_tag instead of #send when rendering tags defined on a Context.
* UndefinedTagError is now thrown when Parser tries to render a tag which doesn't exist on a Context.
* Added Context#tag_missing which works like method_method missing on Object, but is tag specific.

== 0.0.1
* First release.
